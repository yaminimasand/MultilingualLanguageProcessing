# MultilingualLanguageProcessing
The Multilingual Language Translation System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is an innovative and efficient tool for translating text between different languages. Leveraging CNNs allows the model to capture intricate patterns and dependencies in the text, providing high-quality translations at a faster rate compared to traditional models.
To enhance accessibility, the model has been hosted on Streamlit, offering an interactive web interface where users can input text and receive translations in real-time.
